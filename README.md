An example of program execution


	reasoning>> This is an extended propositional backward chaining

	reasoning>> system. Your knowledge base can only accept

	reasoning>> facts like

	reasoning>> P1^P2^...^Pk=>P, or

	reasoning>> P1vP2v...vPk=>P, or

	reasoning>> P.

	reasoning>> Now please input your knowledge base! When you finish

	reasoning>> your input, just type nil!

	reasoning>> AvB=>E

	reasoning>> A^B=>D

	reasoning>> D^E=>F

	reasoning>> B^E=>F

	reasoning>> A

	reasoning>> B

	reasoning>> C

	reasoning>> nil

	reasoning>> You have finished your input. Now you can test your system!

	reasoning>> F?

	reasoning>> yes

	reasoning>> E?

	reasoning>> yes

	reasoning>> D?

	reasoning>> yes

	reasoning>> P?

	reasoning>> no

	reasoning>> quit
